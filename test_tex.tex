First I attached this part of map by ggmap. To run this tex file faster I just attach the picture rather than run the ggmap code in this tex file.\\
\includegraphics[width=15cm,height=15cm,keepaspectratio]{Rplot}\\
Now I have a contour plot from Matlab:\\
\includegraphics[width=15cm,height=15cm,keepaspectratio]{contour}\\
Which clearly shows that there are two peaks of ZRI on Washington D.C and New York.\\
\includegraphics[width=15cm,height=15cm,keepaspectratio]{heatmap}\\
And finally a heat map generated by ggmap in R. It shows the same result.
