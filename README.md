# House-Preference-model
As I am looking for my apartment to rent for the next year, I observed that it cost some time so find a place that exactly meet my desire. So that I intended to build a optimization model for each person to find their own house based on their own consideration of characteristics of an apartment, such as the price, the safety level, and the location from their office or school. Observing that apartments in same area share something in common, I am going to analysis this trend for characteristics of houses. For this report, the focus is on the price of rentals.
